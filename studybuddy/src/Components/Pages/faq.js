                <div class="label">What is the main purpose of Emegle?</div>
                    <div class='content'>
                        <p>During these difficult times living under the global pandemic, students find it very difficult to socialize with their fellow peers. That is why the primary
                            purpose of Emegle is to help build a platform for students to connect with each other. As evident from the name, Emegle comes from the intersection between Education and Omegle, hence an online 'study buddy' platform. </p>

            <div class="contentBx">
                <div class="label">Are the subjects seperated into different levels?</div>
                    <div class='content'>
                        <p> Yes, there is specific chat and video options for a wide range of subjects and levels. When choosing to connect to another 'study buddy', there is an option 
                            to choose what subject you are looking for and what grade/year of studies you are currently in.</p>

            <div class="contentBx">
                <div class="label">Are video calling and chatting both included?</div>
                    <div class='content'>
                        <p> Yes, abdolutely! Both video calling and chatting are included within the 'Connect' page. We believe that having face-to-face interation is very important 
                            thus made video calling a prime feature of the website.</p>
